# Advanced Form with React Hooks

- Uses React Hooks for field validation, error handling and CRUD
- Custom API
- Field validation includes required fields, pattern matching (e.g. email format) and length restrictions
- Customizable field-level error messages
- Field validation can be conditional
- Implements Fabric UI
- Sass (SCSS) for most style
- CSS in JS as needed

## WIP

This is a work in progress. Refer to the issues tab for open to-dos, and feel free to submit issues. I'll update the documentation soon...

### Building the code

```bash
git clone the repo
npm i
npm i -g gulp
gulp
```

This package produces the following:

* lib/* - intermediate-stage commonjs build artifacts
* dist/* - the bundled script, along with other resources
* deploy/* - all resources which should be uploaded to a CDN.

### Build options

gulp clean - TODO
gulp test - TODO
